        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h3>STEM</h3>
        <p>After studying a form of engineering at university (likely mechanical or general), I would like to perhaps continue research into prosthetic robotics.</p>
        <h3>Volunteering</h3>
        <p>I am genuinely extremely passionate about helping others and promoting STEM. I want to help improve the quality of education everywhere as much as possible. I believe that better education will help decrease inequality, greatly impact a community, and change a person's life forever. In fact, it is one of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Volunteering and helping with children and education should not need justifying, and should be encouraged and carried out more.</p>
        <p>Since 2022, I have been volunteering with younger children, in the West London Reading Programme, helping build students' confidence in reading, as a Peer Mentor, providing aid to students with schoolwork and SATs, in the Year 5 Maths Masterclass, helping teach students mathematics, and much more.</p>
        <p>Especially in STEM subjects, which I believe are the road to the future, I strongly believe in providing support to others. Extremely thankful for the resources and quality of education available to me, and aware of the difficulty of providing this. I feel honoured to be able to bring this to others, especially when I can actually see the effects myself. I often can really see the change in my students who have become more eager to learn.</p>
        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>I find artists who can express their feelings and ideas extremely inspiring. I have really enjoyed art from a young age, from producing an image out of nothing, to turning raw materials into something meaningful. I greatly enjoy pottery throwing, which I am lucky enough to know how to do, as well as printmaking, two ancient art forms present all over the world.</p>
        <p>I also enjoy entrepreneurship having won the Innovation Award in the YE Company Programme having produced an accessory to help keep children safe in the dark. I enjoy learning from being in a team, and determinedly working towards a goal. Entrepreneurship is extremely important to help communities, the environment, and to introduce new ideas to the world. I find the feeling of having people want to buy a product that you have made, incredible rewarding, and I feel a strong sense of pride, especially knowing that the money raised goes towards social good.</p>
